# Do whatever you want inside this folder!

The purpose of this hands on session is to get familiar with
- `fork`
- `pull request`
- `git rebase`
- `managing more than one remote`

To to do so, each of the student must

1. fork this repository and add the remote of its fork

```
git remote add a_label_you_like git@github.com:your_github_username/spe_seed.git
```

2.  make some modification to this readme or push a non-empty file
inside this folder

3. open a pull request on master branch of the sissa/spe_seed repository

We will follow together the evolution of the story :)
